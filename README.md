## ✨ The Story Behind This Project

This isn't just another web app — it's a **digital celebration of love**.

When Rashad and Esraa got engaged, they wanted something more personal than a paper card and more memorable than a WhatsApp message. So this invitation was born: a fully immersive, animated experience that guests can open on their phones and feel the warmth of the moment, no matter where they are.

Every animation, every color choice, every line of Arabic calligraphy was placed with intention. The background music (*الليل وسماه*) plays softly as you scroll — because love deserves a soundtrack. 🎶

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

> *"We didn't want it to feel like a website. We wanted it to feel like unfolding a letter."*

### Visual Language
- **Color Palette**: Warm ivories, muted golds (`#c9a87c`), and deep charcoals — a palette inspired by classic wedding stationery
- **Typography**: Serif fonts for elegance, Arabic calligraphy for cultural authenticity, and sans-serif for modern UI elements
- **Motion**: Every section fades in as you scroll, with spring-based easing curves (`[0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]`) that feel organic and unhurried
- **Background**: A subtle rings watermark behind a semi-transparent overlay — present but never distracting

### Accessibility & Performance
- Fully responsive — tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Smooth scroll behavior enabled globally
- Lazy-loaded Google Maps iframe
- Audio plays only on user interaction (no autoplay violations)
- Touch-friendly interactive elements with generous tap targets

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is configured for **GitHub Pages** out of the box:

```bash
# Build and deploy in one command
npm run deploy
```

This runs `vite build` → `gh-pages -d dist`, pushing the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

**Live URL**: [https://Bavly-Hamdy.github.io/Engagement](https://Bavly-Hamdy.github.io/Engagement)
